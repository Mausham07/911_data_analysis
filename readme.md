## Overview

**Project Title**:
911 Calls Data Analysis

**Project Description**:
This project analyzes 911 emergency call data from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to uncover insights related to the volume of calls, reasons for calls, and patterns over time. Using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn, the dataset is explored to extract key statistics and visualize trends with heatmaps, countplots, and clustermaps

**Project Goals**:
* Analyze the most common reasons for 911 calls.
* Explore the time-based patterns in 911 calls (hour, day, and month).
* Visualize the data through heatmaps and clustermaps to show correlations and trends.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install the required libraries listed below:

    * pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn  
2. Download the dataset from kaggle
3. Install and run Jupyter notebook

Instructions for using the software:

1. After installing the libraries, open the Jupyter notebook.
2. Follow along the notebook to explore various questions such as common reasons for calls, calls per township, and time-based visualizations.


## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Python 3.10 or later
* Pandas 1.5.0
* Seaborn 0.11.2
* Matplotlib 3.5.1

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
* [Seaborn Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [911 Emergency Calls dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* Improve performance when working with larger datasets by optimizing Pandas operations.
* Add more advanced visualizations and analysis, such as predicting call volume trends.
* Integrate geographical mapping to visualize call density based on latitude and longitude.
* Add a user interface to allow non-technical users to interact with the analysis.
